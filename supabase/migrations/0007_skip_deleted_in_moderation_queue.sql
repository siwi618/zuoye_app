-- Leave soft-deleted content out of the moderation queue.
--
-- Content is hidden while its author (or, for requests / feedback, either
-- participant) has profiles.is_deleted = true, so there is no point
-- re-moderating it. The rows keep moderated = false, so if the account is
-- restored they re-enter the queue and get checked then.
--
-- Hard-deleted rows are gone from their tables and never appear here.
